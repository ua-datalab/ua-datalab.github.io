### 1. General Learning Objective
By the end of this 8-hour workshop, students will be able to articulate the foundational concepts of data science and machine learning, perform basic data manipulation and visualization tasks using Python, and effectively leverage open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and related tools to assist in their code development, problem-solving, and conceptual understanding within a data science context.

### 2. Topic Summary
This workshop introduces the interdisciplinary field of Data Science, focusing on how to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms. It covers the core principles of Machine Learning (ML), a subset of Artificial Intelligence, where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions. We will explore the typical data science workflow, from data collection and cleaning to model building and evaluation. Emphasis will be placed on practical applications using Python, and how AI/LLM tools can streamline these processes, offering support in coding, debugging, and exploring analytical strategies. The relevance of these skills is paramount in today's data-driven world, impacting research, industry, and decision-making across diverse domains.

### 3. Essential Python Libraries and Tools
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): The fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html): A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures like DataFrames, which are essential for cleaning, transforming, and exploring tabular data.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index) & [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Core libraries for data visualization in Python. Matplotlib provides a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive plots, while Seaborn offers a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* [Scikit-learn (sklearn)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A comprehensive library for machine learning in Python. It features various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.
* [Jupyter Notebooks/JupyterLab](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/): Interactive computing environments that allow you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Ideal for data exploration and iterative development.
* [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index): An open-source library providing thousands of pretrained models, including LLMs, for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other tasks. Students can use it to download and experiment with smaller, open-source LLMs locally for tasks like text generation or code assistance (depending on model capabilities and local compute resources).
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) / [Ollama](https://ollama.com/): Desktop applications that allow users to download and run various open-source LLMs locally. These can be used for interactive querying, code explanation, and problem-solving assistance without relying on cloud-based APIs.
