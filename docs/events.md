## :placard: [The University of Arizona DataLab Workshops](https://www.datascience.arizona.edu/education/uarizona-data-lab) Fall 2024

In collaboration with the Wheeler and Vitali Labs, the DataLab is proud to present four advanced bioinformatics workshops covering key techniques in genomics and transcriptomics.

These workshops provide training in:
- Identifying and annotating transposable elements;
- Building genome-graphs for structural variation analysis;
- Processing RNA-Seq data in R to identify differential gene expression;
- Performing Gene Set Enrichment and Protein-Protein Interaction.
Each session offers practical applications and discussion on the latest tools in bioinformatics research.
