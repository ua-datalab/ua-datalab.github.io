The U of A DataLab develops projects that enable students to apply their AI/Machine Learning knowledge and skills to real-world problems, demonstrating what they've learned throughout their academic program.

### Current ongoing projects

#### College of Information 

* [PubMed Central RAG Agent Chatbot](https://github.com/enoriega/info698-capstone) Agent-based _Retrieval Augmented Generation_ of biological sciences research using LLMs. The outcome of this project will be a conversational chatbot able to retrieve and respond questions from an expansive database created with hundeds of thousands of papers.

* [Deep Learning Pose Estimation](https://github.com/ua-datalab/DL-pose-estimation/wiki). Tracking animal behavior noninvasively is crucial for many scientific fields. Extracting [animal poses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_body_pose_estimation) without markers is essential in biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neuroscience but challenging in dynamic backgrounds.

* [Improving Navigation and Accessibility for the Visually Impaired](https://github.com/ua-datalab/ImprovingNavigationUA/wiki). Visually impaired individuals at the University of Arizona face significant navigation challenges across campus buildings, streets, and walkways. This project explores solutions to enhance accessibility through detailed spatial information and precise guidance for navigation around the University of Arizona campus and surrounding areas. Recent advances in Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models offer promising new opportunities for improved assistive navigation.


* [Analyzing how effective the 2023 rule changes were to MLB viewership & attendance](capstones/readme.md) (TBD). The project analyzes MLB attendance data (2001-2024) to assess how 2023 rule changes affected fan engagement, excluding pandemic-affected 2020-2021 seasons due to attendance restrictions.
