## Data Science Learning Path

We present 12 topics in the data science learning path, providing learning objectives, related skills, subtopics, and references/resources for each. The goal is to give graduate students a structured and comprehensive program to acquire data science expertise, including hands-on experience with real-world open-source tools and libraries.
