## Data Science Learning Path

We present 12 topics in the data science learning path, providing learning objectives, related skills, subtopics, and references/resources for each. The goal is to give graduate students a structured and comprehensive program to acquire data science expertise, including hands-on experience with real-world open-source tools and libraries.

## Working with different data types.

Next you will find five specialized data science learning paths that branch off from the core topics in the previous section. Each specialized path includes a learning objective, related skills, subtopics, and references/resources.
