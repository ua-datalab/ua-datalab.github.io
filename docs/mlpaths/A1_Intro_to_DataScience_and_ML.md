### 2. Topic Overview

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that extracts knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems. Machine Learning (ML), a core component of Artificial Intelligence (AI), provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This module introduces you to the foundational principles that underpin these fields, the typical lifecycle of a data science project (from data acquisition to model deployment and interpretation), and the ethical considerations involved. You'll discover how Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, has become the de facto language for data science, enabling practitioners to tackle complex problems across various domains like healthcare, finance, and technology. Understanding these fundamentals is the first crucial step toward becoming a proficient data scientist.

### 8. Bonus Challenge Problems

These challenges encourage you to synthesize your learning and explore concepts at a deeper analytical level.

1.  **Mini-Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Novel Dataset** (Bloom's: Analyze)
    * **Problem:** Find a small, interesting, and publicly available dataset (e.g., from Kaggle Datasets, UCI Machine Learning Repository - look for simpler ones). Perform a basic EDA. This should include:
        * Loading the dataset.
        * Inspecting its structure, data types, and identifying missing values.
        * Formulating at least three initial questions about the data that you find interesting.
        * Creating at least three distinct types of visualizations to help answer your questions or explore patterns.
        * Writing a brief summary of your findings and any challenges encountered.
    * **Guidance:** Document your steps and reasoning in a Jupyter Notebook. Use LLMs to help you find datasets or to get ideas for relevant questions and visualizations for the dataset you choose. For example, "Suggest interesting questions I can explore in a dataset about [dataset topic]."

2.  **Comparing Classifiers: k-NN vs. Another** (Bloom's: Analyze, Evaluate - introductory level)
    * **Problem:** Using the Iris dataset (or another simple classification dataset you find), train and evaluate the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier as done in the module. Then, research and implement *one* other simple classification algorithm available in Scikit-learn (e.g., Logistic Regression or a Decision Tree).
        * Train this new model on the same training data.
        * Evaluate it on the same test data using accuracy.
        * Briefly compare the results. Which performed better on this specific task?
        * Use an LLM to help you understand the basic principles of the new classifier you chose ("Explain Logistic Regression in simple terms for a beginner").
    * **Guidance:** Document your code and a short comparison of the models' performance and any observations in a Jupyter Notebook. This is not about finding the "best" model in an absolute sense, but about the process of applying and comparing.
