# Take the LEAD with Datalab.

## The Datalab _LEAD Program: Learn, Experience, Advance, Develop_.

### :material-cast-education: Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence Learning Paths

We present 20 topics in the data science learning path, providing learning objectives, related skills, subtopics, and references/resources for each. The goal is to give graduate students a structured and comprehensive program to acquire data science expertise, including hands-on experience with real-world open-source tools and libraries.

-   [<b> :material-creation: A1. Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning</b>](mlpaths/A1_Intro_to_DataScience_and_ML.md)

    ---

    <p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge and insights from data. Machine Learning (ML), a key component of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables systems to learn from data to make decisions or predictions.</p>


-   [<b> :material-poll: A2. Data Analysis with Pandas</b>](mlpaths/A2_Python_for_DataScience.md)

    ---

    <p>Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures, such as Series (1D) and DataFrames (2D), designed to handle tabular datasets efficiently. 


-   [<b> :material-chart-scatter-plot-hexbin: A3. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn</b>](mlpaths/A2_Python_for_DataScience.md)

    ---

    <p>Matplotlib is a library in Python that enables users to generate visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts and much more. Seaborn is a visualization library that is built on top of Matplotlib. It provides data visualizations that are typically more aesthetic and statistically sophisticated.
 

-   <b> :material-scale-balance: A4. Ethical Considerations of Data Science</b>

    ---

    <p>Ethics in data science encompasses the moral principles and guidelines that govern the collection, analysis, and use of data to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes. 

</div>

####  :material-book-open: B. Statistics

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   <b> :material-poll: B1. Descriptive Statistics</b>

    ---

    <p>Descriptive Statistics is a set of brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set representative of an entire or sample population.

-   <b> :material-dice-6-outline: B2. Probability Distributions</b>

    ---

    <p>In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is a function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of possible events for an experiment.

-   <b> :material-ab-testing: B3. Inferential Statistics</b>

    ---

    <p>Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.

-   <b> :material-update: B4. Bayesian Statistics</b>

    ---

    <p>Bayesian statistics is a method of statistical inference that uses Bayes' Theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. 


</div>


####  :material-book-open: C. Machine Learning

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   <b> :material-chart-line: C1. Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn</b>

    ---

    <p>Scikit-learn is a powerful and widely used Python library for machine learning. 

-   <b> :material-view-dashboard: C2. Unsupervised Learning</b>

    ---

    <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures without specific guidance or desired outputs.

-   <b> :material-human-male-board-poll: C3. Supervised Learning</b>

    ---

    <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns to predict an output variable by being trained on a labeled dataset. 

-   <b> :material-ballot: C4. Ensemble Learning</b>

    ---

    <p>Ensemble learning in machine learning combines multiple individual models (base learners) to create a more accurate and robust predictive model than any single model alone.
