## The Data Science Ecosystem

![UA DS Ecosystem](images/DS-Ecosystem-UA.jpg){width=1200}

The University of Arizona campus has diverse data science needs served by specialized campus units. These units collaborate both formally and informally, each providing unique expertise to specific audiences. Together, they deliver comprehensive campus support that would be impossible for any single unit alone.

### Data science units

* **Data Science Team** Delivers workshops on reproducible research for CALES/ALVSCE researchers, focusing on ecology and bioinformatics. Offers in-depth support through the Data Science Incubator for research analysis and stakeholder outreach. [https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/)

* **DataLab** A joint initiative of the Data Science Institute and Institute for Computation and Data-enabled Insight offering intermediate workshops on AI, machine learning, genomics, and natural language processing.

* **Research Bazaar** A research computing community hosting twice-weekly office hours for advanced users on and off campus. [https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/)

* **Research Computing** Provides HPC resources support through workshops and consultations. Based in UITS, serves users with computational expertise or those needing national computing resources. [https://it.arizona.edu/research-resources](https://it.arizona.edu/research-resources)

* **StatLab** BIO5's StatLab offers campus-wide statistical consulting through free initial consultations, paid in-depth support, and grant collaboration options. [https://statlab.bio5.org/](https://statlab.bio5.org/)

* **University Libraries** Provides introductory workshops and consultations focused on scientific programming, geospatial analysis, and data management for reproducible research. [https://data.library.arizona.edu](https://data.library.arizona.edu/)
