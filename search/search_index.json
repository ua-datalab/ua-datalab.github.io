It's running much slower than expected. How could an LLM potentially help you optimize it (without directly accessing your system)?     a)  By remotely debugging your script on your machine.     b.  By explaining common Python performance bottlenecks, suggesting more efficient Pandas/NumPy functions for tasks you describe (e.g., replacing row-wise iteration with vectorized operations), or helping refactor a specific slow code snippet you provide.     c.  By rewriting the entire script in C++ for you.     d.  By telling you to buy a faster computer. (Answer: b)</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the purpose of <code>df.info()</code> for a Pandas DataFrame <code>df</code>?     a)  To display the first 5 rows.     b)  To provide a summary of descriptive statistics.     c.  To show a concise summary including the index dtype and columns, non-null values, and memory usage.     d)  To check for duplicate rows.

Bonus Challenge Problems","text":"<p>These challenges are designed to push your analytical and Python data handling skills further.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Comprehensive Sales Data Analysis Pipeline (Bloom's: Analyze, Evaluate)</p> <ul> <li>Problem: Find a multi-file sales dataset (or generate a plausible one with an LLM, e.g., one file for transactions, one for product details, one for store locations). Your task is to create a full data pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook that:<ol> <li>Loads data from multiple sources.</li> <li>Cleans each dataset thoroughly (handle missing values, correct data types, standardize text, remove duplicates).</li> <li>Merges these datasets into a single analytical DataFrame.</li> <li>Performs EDA: Generate at least five distinct and insightful visualizations (e.g., sales trends over time, top-selling products, sales by region, correlation between product price and quantity sold). For each visualization, write a brief interpretation.</li> <li>Derive at least two new features that might be useful (e.g., profit margin if cost data is available/creatable, sales per square foot if store size is available/creatable, day of the week of sale).</li> <li>Summarize your key findings and any data quality issues or limitations you encountered.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Guidance: Justify your cleaning and transformation choices. Use LLMs to brainstorm potential new features or to get ideas for impactful visualizations given the (actual or mock) data. Focus on clear, well-commented code and insightful interpretations.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Time-Series Data Anomaly Detection and Smoothing (Bloom's: Analyze, Evaluate)</p> <ul> <li>Problem: Obtain a simple time-series dataset (e.g., daily stock prices for a single stock over a year, monthly temperature readings for a city). Your task is to:<ol> <li>Load and preprocess the time-series data (ensure dates are proper datetime objects, handle missing values using time-series appropriate methods like interpolation).</li> <li>Visualize the raw time series.</li> <li>Implement a simple method to detect potential anomalies or outliers (e.g., values exceeding a certain rolling standard deviation, or using interquartile range on differences). Clearly mark these on your plot.</li> <li>Apply a smoothing technique (e.g., a simple moving average) to the time series and plot the smoothed series alongside the original.</li> <li>Discuss the effect of the smoothing technique and the rationale for your anomaly detection method. What are the pros and cons of the methods you chose?</li> </ol> </li> <li>Guidance: Pandas has excellent time-series capabilities (e.g., <code>resample()</code>, <code>rolling()</code>).
